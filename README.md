This repository demonstrates an uncommon CSS error related to the `calc()` function.  Extra whitespace between operators and operands within the `calc()` function can lead to unexpected rendering results. The `bug.css` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version.  This is a subtle issue that can be difficult to debug, especially in complex CSS.
