The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, if there are spaces between the operator and operands, the calculation may fail. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px)` works correctly, but `width: calc(100%  -  10px)` will fail. This can lead to unexpected layout issues or the element not rendering properly.
